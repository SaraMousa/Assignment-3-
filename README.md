# Assignment-3-

For this project I wanted to make a room in which a person was trapped and they had to escape by clicking on some puzzle blocks. 
For the cooperative version, one person had the blocks and the other person that is trapped would recieve them
For the competitive, both players had to race against the clock to excape first.

Challenges: My room obj would not load in properly. Also I could not find material as to using websockets, such as a timer or loading in objects/shapes. 

Scussesses: managed to make a puzzle peice appear on the screen of the other player, and that player can make it dissapear, signifying solving a piece of the puzzl.
